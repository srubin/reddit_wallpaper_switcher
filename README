The Reddit Wallpaper Switcher for Mac OS X will grab the top image (.jpg) in a
subreddit, copy it into a local folder, and then set it as the desktop
background image in Mac OS X.

Requires reddit_api python module, which can be found at
	 https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api

To select a subreddit, edit the PICTURES_SUBREDDIT variable in image_grabber.py
To select a local folder, edit the PICS_DIRECTORY variable in image_grabber.py

To set this up to run every, say, 30 minutes, add the cronjob
*/30 * * * * /path/to/image_grabber.py
